    "4. Methods and Plans\n",
    "   To address my question of whether player characteristics can predict whether a player is a high-data or low-data contributor, I propose using a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classification model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions. KNN requires that distances meaningfully represent similarity, so all numeric variables (Age, played_hours, session-based variables) must be standardized. Categorical variables such as gender and experience will need to be converted into dummy variables. The method also assumes that nearby points in feature space tend to share the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations. KNN is sensitive to irrelevant predictors, noise, and differences in scale; it may also perform poorly if classes are imbalanced or if there are many dummy variables, which increases dimensionality. KNN may become less reliable in sparse regions of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model comparison and selection. I will evaluate different values of k using classification error on a validation set or through cross-validation within the training set. The value of k that minimizes error will be chosen as the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data processing plan. Before modeling, I will: (1) merge the datasets and compute total_session_minutes; (2) convert categorical variables into dummy variables; (3) standardize numeric predictors; (4) split the data into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split. The split will occur after preprocessing but before model fitting. Cross-validation may be used within the training set to choose the best k.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach provides a clear and justified method for predicting which kinds of players contribute the most gameplay data."
